        <p style = "margin-left: 30px"> This is one of the lighter projects I did in my high school career. At the start of my 12th grade, I created a Trebuchet made of cardboard. The arm was a </p>
        <p> modified pencil. The sling was made of cardboard. All the materials were put together with a hot glue gun and some tape. The arm holder was also a modified </p>
        <p> pencil. Strings would apply the potential energy to the arm. I used a motor with its servo arm to contain this potential energy and keep the arm at rest. </p>
        <p> This motor was connected to the system controller, which was coded in Java. I coded the buttons so that one button would turn the servo arm, letting go of the arm, </p>
        <p> converting its potential energy to kinetic, and shooting its payload. Another would turn the servo arm so the trebuchet arm would stay in one place. </p>
        <p> The payload that the trebuchet would shoot would be ping pong balls. The trebuchet shot ping pong balls at a distance of approximately 7 meters. </p>
        <p> The design of the trebuchet is displayed below: </p>

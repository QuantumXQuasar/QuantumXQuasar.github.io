    <p style = "margin-left: 30px"> In the summer after my junior year of High School, I experienced the golden moments of the Summer Science program. I completed the program in </p>
    <p> Astrophysics, where a cohort of 36 students, including me, participated in 39 days of enlightening research experience. We were separated into groups </p>
    <p> of three, and each team was assigned its own unique asteroid to research. My team and I used a research-grade telescope to observe the asteroid (ours </p>
    <p> was 1866 Sysiphus). After, we used image reduction to figure out the right ascension and the decline of the asteroid (basically latitude and longitude </p>
    <p> but for the celestial sphere rather than Earth). Next, we determined the sun-asteroid velocity and position vector of our asteroid using the method of </p>
    <p> Gauss â€“ the famous approximation method, which approximates the 3 axis of the asteroid-sun's velocity and position vector. After determining the velocity </p>
    <p> and position vector, we used more complex equations to assess 6 orbital elements of the asteroid: The longitude of the ascending node, inclination, eccentricity, </p>
    <p> argument of perihelion, the semi-major axis, and the mean anomaly.</p>

    <p style = "margin-left: 30px"> Apart from the research, we also attended lectures held by professors. Professors taught us multivariable calculus and linear algebra-based </p>
    <p> physics, astronomy, and Python packages such as numpy and matplotlib. We also collaborated on Psets, which were so challenging that they made us collaborate </p>
    <p> so much and utilize each other's unique abilities to complete them. Psets consisted of Linear algebra and Multivariable calculus math and physics questions, </p>
    <p> astronomy questions about how telescopes work, CCDs, and usage of celestial coordinates; moreover, we used our math skills in coding the formulas with numpy </p>
    <p> and plotting the data with matplotlib. Outside work, we played pool and table tennis, had a talent show, played tag, and went on field trips.</p>

    <p> the Psets, and all the fun activities we did together were indeed one of a kind. If I could wipe my memory and go back in time, I would do it all over again. </p>

    <p style = "margin-left: 30px"> After completing SSP, I had the privilege of attending yet another great summer program: the Summer High School Academic Program for Engineers (SHAPE) </p>
    <p> in Electrical Engineering. The program was held at Columbia University. My peers (in total, about 25 students) and I were taught the physics behind electrodynamics. </p>
    <p> We were split into groups of about 4 people, in which we worked with breadboards, LED lights, system controllers, etc., which we coded using C++. I was the main coder, </p>
    <P> documenter, and engineer and did the main calculations. We built a solar oven, which is displayed below. We measured the temperature using a thermocouple, which we </P>
    <p> created using our materials. The sun would heat the solar, which would direct its heat to the black trash bag. </p>
